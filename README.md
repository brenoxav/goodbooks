This is my capstone project for the Ruby on Rails path of the Microverse program.
It is my attempt at implementing an MVP version of "Goodbooks": a twitter-like app with working features, such as:
- Simple login function (sessions)
- Side panel with user's info, stats and navigation links
- Form to post "opinions"
- Homepage listing user's latest "opinions"
- Side panel showing suggestions for "who to follow" (homepage)
- Userpage with their latest posted "opinions"
- Side panel showing user's profile, stats, and followers (user page)
- Button to "follow" users
